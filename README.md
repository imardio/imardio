- 👋 Hi, I’m Mauricio Maldonado (@imardio).
- 👀 I’m interested in chemistry, physics, math, music and videogames. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming. I'm mostly focused on Python because it's very easy to get started with it, but I'm also learning JavaScript and Go. My current long term goal in programming is creating an open code to process and interpret quantum chemical calculations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of this package to aid chemist, physicists and molecular scientists. If you're interested, feel free to contact me.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can just email me at mauricio.maldonado@jh-inst.cas.cz
